This Docker base image has been custom crafted from source to provide just enough functionality in the tiniest footprint. Included in the image are the following:
 - GNU libc6 (glibc) - _C standard library, found in most linux distributions_ | https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/
 - Busybox - _The Swiss army-knife of linux with hundreds of common utilities_ | https://busybox.net/about.html
 - LibreSSL - _An OpenSSL fork aiming to modernise code and improve security_ | https://www.libressl.org/

Additionally, the following small utilities have been included for convenience and good container practice:
 - su-exec - _A convenient utility for changing user and dropping privilege_ | https://github.com/frebib/su-exec
 - tini - _A tiny but valid `init` for containers_ | https://github.com/krallin/tini

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

There are two main streams of this image: with and without LibreSSL. You can find the dockerfiles below

* `latest` - [(master/dockerfile)](https://github.com/spritsail/busybox/blob/master/Dockerfile)
* `libressl` - [(libressl/dockerfile)](https://github.com/spritsail/busybox/blob/libressl/Dockerfile)

## Goals for a base image

Occasionally there are opportunities where alternative standard libc implementations ([musl][musl]/[uclibc][uclibc]) won't do, like in the case of [proprietary](http://i.imgur.com/V5K7N1I.jpg) software like [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/downloads/) where only pre-compiled binaries are provided which were built against the common glibc library.

(_If your use-case doesn't require glibc and you can compile the program from source, we strongly recommend you use the [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/\_/alpine) image, based on musl, which is smaller and features a full packaging system_)

- The image had to be _small_, whilst still being fully functional
- It should contain a full GNU glibc implementation to support pre-compiled binaries
- There should be enough common system tools available, either GNU coreutils or busybox
- Optionally a pre-installed SSL library as many applications require it
