This Docker base image has been custom crafted from source to provide just enough functionality in the tiniest footprint. It is based on the [spritsail/busybox](https://github.com/spritsail/busybox) base image, and then builds upon it. It also contains:

* LibreSSL - _An OpenSSL fork aiming to modernise code and improve security_ | https://www.libressl.org/
